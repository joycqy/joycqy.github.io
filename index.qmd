Welcome to my website!<br>

Iâ€™m a PhD candidate in the [Department of Applied Economics](https://apec.umn.edu/) at the University of Minnesota. My fields of interest include agribusiness, food and agricultural economics, empirical IO, and environmental economics.

My research addresses complex and topical economic problems in food and agricultural markets, focusing on the impact of climate shocks on agrifood systems and farmland consolidation, as well as the effects of food price inflation on retail landscapes and consumer welfare.

<strong>I will be on the job market in the 2024-2025 academic year.</strong>

Here is the latest version of my <a href="CV_Cai.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a>.
