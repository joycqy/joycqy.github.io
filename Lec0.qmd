::: {.panel-tabset}
### Intro

+ This one-week course is a boot camp designed to introduce you to R statistical software. My goal is to build a strong foundation for your Ph.D.-level econometrics courses and future research.  
<br>

- **By the end of this week, you will be able to:**  
  - to create and manipulate the base-R object data.  
  
  - to do data manipulation with `data.table` package.  
  
  - to do data visualization with `ggplot2` package.  
  
  - to conduct regression analysis with `lm()` and make a publish-ready regression table with `modelsummary()` package.  
  
  - to write Monte code for Carlo simulations using `for loop` function.

### Style

- We will meet each day from 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM, with office hours immediately following.  

- Each lecture is divided into three sessions, with each session consisting of a 50-minute lecture and a 10-minute break.  

- We will have in-class exercises at the end of each topic, and after-class exercises (optional) to practice!

# Motivation to learn R 

## What is R? {.center}

- R is a powerful programming language for a wide range of tasks:  
  - Data Manipulation: cleaning, reshaping, merging datasets, API.  
  - Various Analysis: descriptive analysis, regression, GIS, spatial analysis, machine learning.  
  - Data visualization.  
 
- It's a great tool to communicate your results with others (documentation, papers, slides, books, etc.).  


**Comparison of R, Stata, and Python**  

| **Criteria**        | **R**                                                                 | **Stata**                                                  | **Python**                                     |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Primary Use          | Statistical analysis, visualization, research                        | Economics/social science research; valued for tested results | General-purpose; machine learning, web scraping, automation |
| Cost                 | Open-source                                                          | Commercial license                                         | Open-source                                   |
| Data Visualization   | Excellent                                                            | Less flexible or aesthetically pleasing                   | Very powerful, but can be verbose             |
| Ecosystem            | Large academic community; many packages on CRAN                      | Strong in economics but smaller user base                 | Huge, diverse community                       |
| Handling Big Data    | Base R is memory-bound; packages like `data.table` / `arrow` improve performance | Memory-bound                                              | Excellent                                    |


## AI and Learning R{.center}

- AI can help, but it cannot replace understanding.  
  - Tools like ChatGPT or Copilot can generate R code, but you need to know if the code is **correct** and **appropriate**.  
  - You’ll understand why a method works, not just how to run it.
  
- Academic integrity & skill development.   
  - Employers and researchers may expect you to adapt and debug code yourself.  
  
- Long-term benefit.
  - Once you know R, AI becomes a more powerful assistant — you can ask better questions and spot mistakes.


## R in the APEC curriculum{.center}

- We use R extensively in the Econometrics series (APEC 8211-8214).  
  - To conduct regression analysis (OLS, IV, FE, etc.).  
  - To conduct Monte Carlo simulations.  
    - e.g., To understand the difference in variance inference techniques.  
<br>

-  Don’t worry if you are new to this!  
   - Basic knowledge is enough to start.  
   - If you would like to learn R programming further, I recommend that you take Programming for Econometrics (APEC8221) and Big Data Methods in Economics (APEC8222).


## Rstudio

<!-- start panel:Rstudio   --> 
:::{.panel-tabset}  
### What is it?

+ You can use [{{< fa brands r-project >}}]{style="color:steelblue"} app to write and run R codes, but it has a terrible graphic user interface.
+ [**Rstudio**]{style="color:steelblue"} is an Integrated Development Environment. It provides a user-friendly interface to write and run R code, view plots, and manage files.
+ You must install R (the engine) before you can use RStudio!

+ R studio looks like this: 

![[Image Source: Rstudio User Guide](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/ui/appearance.html#:~:text=To%20switch%20between%20RStudio%20themes,use%20the%20RStudio%20theme%20dropdown.)](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/ui/images/rstudio-panes-labeled.jpeg){width=43%}

### Create New R code File

- To create new R script file, click the `+` button on the top-left corner of the Rstudio, or hit `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `N` (`Cmd` + `Shift` + `N` on mac).  

- To save the file, click the floppy disk icon {{< fa floppy-disk >}}, or `Ctrl` + `S` (`Cmd` + `S` on macOS).

![[Image Source: Rstudio User Guide](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/ui/appearance.html#:~:text=To%20switch%20between%20RStudio%20themes,use%20the%20RStudio%20theme%20dropdown.)](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/ui/images/files-menu.png){width=35%}

### Change the theme (Optional)

- You can change the appearance of Rstudio by going to `Tools` -> `Global Options` -> `Appearance` -> `Editor theme` and select your favorite theme.

![[Image Source: Rstudio User Guide](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/ui/appearance.html#:~:text=To%20switch%20between%20RStudio%20themes,use%20the%20RStudio%20theme%20dropdown.)](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/ui/images/rstudio-theme.png){width=38%}


### Multiple panes (Optional)

- You can have multiple code panes in Rstudio.  
- To create a new pane, go to `Tools` -> `Global Options` -> `Pane Layout` -> `Add Column`.  
- In the same window, you can also change the layout of the panes.

![](image/rstudio.png){width=40% fig-align=center}


### Command Palette (Optional)

- Recent R-studio has a new feature called "Command Palette."   
- Hit `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` (`Cmd` + `Shift` + `P` on macOS) on your keyboard, or go to `Tools` -> `Show Command Palette`.  

- From here, you can search for and do almost anything: create new files, open projects, etc.

## Rstudio: Running Code {.center}


Let's write some codes. 

```{webr-r}
print("Hello, World!")

# This is a comment block.
```
<br>

**R code**

- Any thing you write in the source (or console) pane is regarded as R code.  
- To run (execute) the code, select the code line, and click the "Run" bottom, or use the shortcut key: `Ctrl` + `Enter` (`Cmd` + `Enter` on macOS).


**Comment block**

- Any line starting with a `#` is a comment. R will ignore it. Use comments to leave notes for yourself and others!


## Summary {.center}  

<br>

- You are now familiar with the basics of RStudio. As long as you know how to create, save, and run a script, you are ready for the next lecture.<br><br>

- For more details, see the [official RStudio IDE Cheatsheet](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/html/rstudio-ide.html?_gl=1*4yeznz*_ga*MjA3NjIxNzk0Ny4xNzE1NjIyMzk3*_ga_2C0WZ1JHG0*MTcyMzc2ODk2Ny41Ni4xLjE3MjM3NzM3NzQuMC4wLjA.){target="_blank"}.<br><br>

- While RStudio is the most popular tool, you can also run R in other editors like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/r){target="_blank"} to run R. Nevertheless, Rstudio is a great starting point to get familiar with R.
